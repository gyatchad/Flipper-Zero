### **How-to-Guide: Creating a Custom Plugin for the Flipper Zero**

#### **Introduction**

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a custom plugin for the Flipper Zero. Plugins enhance the functionality of the Flipper Zero by adding new features or modifying existing ones. We'll go through the process step-by-step, from setting up the development environment to creating and testing your plugin.

#### **What You'll Need**

- A Flipper Zero device
- A computer with a suitable development environment (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Basic knowledge of C or C++
- The latest Flipper Zero firmware source code

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment**

1. **Install the Necessary Tools:**
   - **Git**: For cloning source code repositories.
   - **CMake**: For configuring and building the project.
   - **GCC Compiler**: For compiling the code (if not already installed).

2. **Clone the Flipper Zero Firmware Repository:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
   cd flipperzero-firmware
   ```

3. **Install All Required Dependencies:**
   Follow the instructions in the repository to install any additional packages and tools needed for development.

#### **Step 2: Create Your Plugin**

1. **Create a New Plugin Folder:**
   Navigate to the `applications/plugins` directory and create a new folder for your plugin:
   ```bash
   mkdir applications/plugins/my_custom_plugin
   cd applications/plugins/my_custom_plugin
   ```

2. **Create the Basic Files:**
   - **`CMakeLists.txt`**: Create a file named `CMakeLists.txt` with the following content:
     ```cmake
     add_plugin(my_custom_plugin main.c)
     ```
   - **`main.c`**: Create a file named `main.c` with the following content:
     ```c
     #include <flipper_zero.h>

     void my_custom_plugin_function() {
         // Add your custom logic here
     }

     int main() {
         my_custom_plugin_function();
         return 0;
     }
     ```

#### **Step 3: Build and Test the Plugin**

1. **Build the Firmware:**
   Navigate to the firmware directory and build the firmware with your plugin:
   ```bash
   cd firmware
   cmake .
   make
   ```

2. **Copy the Plugin to Your Flipper Zero:**
   Transfer the compiled plugin to your Flipper Zero via USB or SD card.

3. **Test the Plugin:**
   Power on the Flipper Zero and check if your plugin appears in the menu. Test its functionality to ensure it works as expected and troubleshoot any issues.

#### **Step 4: Document and Share (If you want)**

1. **Document Your Plugin:**
   Create a README file in your plugin folder to explain how to install and use your plugin. Include instructions and relevant information for users.

2. **Share Your Plugin:**
   Create a GitHub repository for your plugin and share it with the Flipper Zero community. This will allow others to use, contribute to, and provide feedback on your plugin.

#### **Conclusion**

In this guide, youâ€™ve learned how to create a custom plugin for the Flipper Zero. This process enhances your skills with the device and contributes to the open-source community by providing additional functionality for other users.
